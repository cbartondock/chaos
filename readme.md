#Python and C tools for studying Dynamical Systems

##Requirements
These tools require a C compiler, Python (version >= 2.7), and the following python modules:
- numpy
- matplotlib
- ctypes
- cPickle
- graph_tool

##Installation
I recommend installing the first four python modules with the Python Package Index (pip). See https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pip.
For graph_tool, see https://graph-tool.skewed.de/download. For OS X users we recommend using homebrew to install graph_tool. We also caution that graph_tool is large, and sometimes quite difficult to install. As it is only used in our Morse Decomposition program, the user may find graph_tool unnecessary for their needs.

If you don't have a c compiler, we again recommend using homebrew (OS X) and apt-get for Linux users. To make, simply type:

'''
cd chaos
make -f make_all
''
